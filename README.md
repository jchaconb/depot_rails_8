This repository contains my implementation of the **Depot** application following the book  
**_Agile Web Development with Rails 8_** by **Sam Ruby** (The Pragmatic Bookshelf, June 2025).

The goal of this project is to explore and practice the modern features introduced in Rails 8, including:

- ✅ **Kamal 2** deployment
- ✅ **Thruster** and updated JavaScript integration
- ✅ **New database adapters**
- ✅ Built-in **authentication generator**
- ✅ **Asset pipeline replacement**
- ✅ **WebSockets / ActionCable**
- ✅ **ActiveJob** for background processing
- ✅ Tests using built-in unit, integration, and system frameworks
- ✅ Internationalization and secure deployment

## 📘 About the Book

> The eighth major release of Rails focuses on the ability to produce production-ready applications, while retaining the ability to produce fantastic user experiences.  
> Rails 8 delivers all the benefits of single-page applications at a fraction of the complexity.  
> With the introduction of **Kamal 2**, **Thruster**, new database adapters, a completely redesigned asset layer, and a new **authentication generator**, Rails once again enables individuals to build modern, competitive applications quickly and efficiently.

This book walks you through the development of a real-world store application (the **Depot**) in a step-by-step manner. You’ll learn how to:

- Build modern Rails applications from scratch
- Incorporate JavaScript seamlessly
- Send/receive email
- Run background jobs using **ActiveJob**
- Add real-time features with **WebSockets**
- Write comprehensive test suites
- Internationalize your app
- Deploy easily and securely

> _“Rails itself is tested against the code in this book.”_
